# PA-EVIO: Polarity-aided Event-Visual-Inertial Odometry


## Introduction
Event cameras have received extensive research interest because of their advantages over conventional cameras in high-speed motion and high-dynamic-range (HDR) environments. In this project, we present a polarity-aided event-visual-inertial odometry system (PA-EVIO) that integrates the time-surface generation module, the feature processing module, and the state estimator module.
